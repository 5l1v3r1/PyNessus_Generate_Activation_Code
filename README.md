# Nessus-Home-Activation-Key-Generation

Nessus Home Activation Key Generation without visiting a Nessus website by python script

NessusReg.py/TempMailServer.py:
Usage:

Run Nessusreg.py script to register a new Nessus account to receive activation code to ur mail.

Enter ur first name and last name,then i know u need a mail id to receive so i create a TempMailServer.py script to get a temporary mail service to recieve a nessus activation code.

Then run TempMailServer.py and enter ur random id and domain name to get new mail id.

you will see the message mail was sucessfully created and then wait for a moment before pressing enter go to other terminal where you run NessusReg.py script and enter ur mail id and press enter.

Move to TempMailServer.py terminal now press enter to recieve your aactivation code.

you can use this script for many times to create  temporary mail id to get nessus activation code after the IP limit exceeds in Nessus Vulnerability Scanner in Home version.

Next  my  Python script is to  get activation code for Nessus Professional Version..

Thank You......
